            <p class="lm">property can also be used to float multiple elements at once.
                 However, when multiple floated elements have different heights, 
                 it can affect their layout on the page. Specifically, 
                 elements can “bump” into each other and not allow other elements to
                  properly move to the left or right.</p>
            <div class="box"></div>
            <P class="ln">As you have seen, padding is space added inside an element’s border, 
                while margin is space added outside an element’s border. One additional differenc
                 is that top and bottom margins,also called vertical margins, collapse, 
                 while top and bottom padding does not. Horizontal margins (left and right), like 
                 padding, are always displayed and added together. For example, if two divs with 
                 ids #div-one and #div-two, are next to each other, they will be as far apart as 
                 the sum of their adjacent margins.</P>
